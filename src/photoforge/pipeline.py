    This orchestration function is the sole integration point for contextual
    grouping. It composes scanning, planning, and contextual grouping while
    keeping each responsibility in its existing module.

    Rules enforced by this function:
    - scanning is delegated to scanner.scan_directory(...)
    - planning is delegated to the existing planner entry point unchanged
    - contextual grouping is computed exactly once from the complete valid
      ``tuple[FileRecord, ...]`` returned by the scanner
    - the resulting ``ContextualGrouping`` is returned separately and is not
      embedded into existing pipeline models

    ``planner_args`` and ``planner_kwargs`` are forwarded directly to the
    planner entry point so the existing planning interface can remain unchanged.
